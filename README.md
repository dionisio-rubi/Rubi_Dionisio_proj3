# Rubi_Dionisio_proj3
# CS 219 Project 3 #
Created by Rubi Dionisio

## Contains ##
* This program contains the following files:
    * main.cpp
    * ARMInstruct.cpp
    * ARMInstruct.h
    * FileManager.cpp
    * FileManager.h
    * makefile

## How to Use ##
* To compile simply type "make".
* Once code has compiled type "./proj3" to see the output in the terminal.

## Key Notes ##
* When the program prints out all the registers, the actual values in hex are lowercase, but they are the correct values according to the sample output on canvas.
* Within the code, there are more detailed comments as to how everything, including the functions, works.
* There is only one class (ARMInstruct) that has all the computations for each of the instructions depending on which instruction is called, the coorespinding function will be called within that class that cooresponds to the specific instruction needed.
